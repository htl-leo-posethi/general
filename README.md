# General Information about Theoretical Informatics Winter Term
## Overview
We deal with more theoretical material which is part of computer science like 

- Propositional logic
- Predicate Logic
- Proofs
- Formal languages

you will find a complete list of the material we cover in the [syllabus](Syllabus.md). A lot of this material may look like math to you but don't worry, this will maybe help you more in your regular math courses than being a hard to understand.
