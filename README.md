# General Information about Theoretical Informatics Winter Term
## Overview
We deal with more theoretical material which is part of computer science like 

- Propositional logic
- Predicate Logic
- Proofs
- Formal languages

you will find a complete list of the material we cover in the [syllabus](Syllabus.md). A lot of this material may look like math to you but don't worry, this will maybe help you more in your regular math courses than being a hard to understand.

## Content
### Unit 1 - Organizational
We will get an overview of the course and fix the organizational framework like quizzes, tests, grading, communication. Details to be found in the [handout](Unit01_Organizational/OrganizationalAndOverviewHandout.pdf).

### Unit 2 - Basic Propositional Logic
We will talk about propositions, their compositions, the properties of these compositions and propositional logic formulas. Material to be found:
- [Handout](Unit02_BasicPropositionalLogic/Presentation/02_PropositionalLogicBasics_lecture.pdf)
- [Graded Exercise](Unit02_BasicPropositionalLogic/Exercises/Exercise2.pdf)
- [More examples](Unit02_BasicPropositionalLogic/Exercises/Exercise2MoreExamples/Exercise2MoreExamples.pdf) as training material for quizzes and tests
