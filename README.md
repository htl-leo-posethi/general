# General Information about Theoretical Informatics Winter Term
## Overview
We deal with more theoretical material which is part of computer science like 

- Propositional logic
- Predicate Logic
- Proofs
- Formal languages

you will find a complete list of the material we cover in the [syllabus](Syllabus.md). A lot of this material may look like math to you but don't worry, this will maybe help you more in your regular math courses than being a hard to understand.

## Content
### Unit 1 - Organizational
We will get an overview of the course and fix the organizational framework like quizzes, tests, grading, communication.

Class material

- [Handout](Unit01_Organizational/OrganizationalAndOverviewHandout.pdf)
- [Graded Exercise](https://github.com/htl-leo-posethi/coding-assignment1-gcd.git)

### Unit 2 - Basic Propositional Logic
We will talk about propositions, their compositions, the properties of these compositions and propositional logic formulas.

Class material
- [Handout](Unit02_BasicPropositionalLogic/Presentation/02_PropositionalLogicBasics_lecture.pdf)
- [Graded Exercise](Unit02_BasicPropositionalLogic/Exercises/Exercise2.pdf)
- [More examples](Unit02_BasicPropositionalLogic/Exercises/Exercise2MoreExamples/Exercise2MoreExamples.pdf) as training material for quizzes and tests

### Unit 3 - Minimizing Propositional Formulas
In this unit we will discuss three different ways how we can minimize propositional formulas. This is great since it helps us to design electronic circuits with minimal costs or to make things easier to understand. As a bonus we also learn first steps to proof propositions.

Class Material
- [Handout](Unit03_MinimizingFormulas/Presentation/03_MinimizingFormulas_lecture.pdf)
- [Graded Exercise](./Unit03_MinimizingFormulas/Exercise3.pdf)

### Unit 4 - Predicate Logic
In this unit we will discuss how to enhance our means to express more general propositions. We will step from general propositions to a level where we can transform arbitrary real world problems into mathematical models. We will see that math is nothing else but a very powerful programming language.

Class Material
- [Handout](./Unit04_PredicateLogic/Presentation/04_PredicateLogic_lecture.pdf)
- [Graded Exercise](./Unit04_PredicateLogic/Exercises/Exercise4.pdf)

### Unit 5 - Proofs
In this unit we will reconsider proofs. With our new knowledge gained from the previous unit we will also enhance our skills in proofing. In this case we will learn how to argue carefully.

Class Material
- [Handout](./Unit05_Proofs/Presentation/05_Proofs_lecture.pdf)
- [Graded Exercise](./Unit05_Proofs/Exercises/Exercise5/ExerciseProofs.pdf)
- [More Examples](./Unit05_Proofs/Exercises/Exercise5MoreExamples/Exercise5MoreExamples.pdf)

### Unit 6 - Prolog Basics
In this unit we will familiarize ourselves with *Prolog* a programming language purely based on a logical calculus. You may find things a bit unclear at the beginning since the language misses the usual conditional and looping constructs but at the end you will be able to see the strengths of this approach.

Class Material:
- [Handout](./Unit06_PrologBasics/gPrologReference.md)
- [Graded Exercise](./Unit06_PrologBasics/CodingAssignment.md)

### Unit 7 - Prolog Recursion and Lists
In this unit we are repeating recursion and how this is done in Prolog. Based on this we can start working with lists and learn the power of this concept in Prolog.

Class Material:
- [Handout](./Unit07_PrologLists/RecursionAndLists.md)
- [Graded Exercise](./Unit07_PrologLists/CodingAssignment.md)

### Project - Prolog Text Adventures
In this unit we will deepen our understanding of Prolog and get some hints how to write an adventure game in Prolog

Class Material:
- [Handout](./Unit08_PrologTextAdventures/Readme.md)
