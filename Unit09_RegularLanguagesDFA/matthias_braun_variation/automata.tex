    \item An automaton consists of \textbf{states} % Maybe insert a circled q0
    \item An automaton can \textbf{transition} from state to state
    \item An automaton reads a string from left to right, one character at a time
    \item Each new character can put the automaton into a new state
    % TODO: Replace "final state" with "accepting state". Hopcroft and Ullman use this term on page 19 of "Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation"
    \item If the automaton is in a \textbf{final}\footnote<5->{a better word for \enquote{final} is probably \enquote{accepting}} state after reading the last character, the string is valid

  \begin{itemize}
    \item This automaton has three states: $q_0, q_1, q_2$
    \item I has two transitions: \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\delta (q_0, a) = q_1$
        \item $\delta (q_1, b) = q_2$
    \end{enumerate}
  \item That means: \begin{enumerate}
      \item If the automaton is in state $\mathbf{q_0}$ and the current character of the input string is \enquote{\textbf{a}}, the automaton goes into state $\mathbf{q_1}$
      \item If the automaton is in state $\mathbf{q_1}$ and the current character of the input string is \enquote{\textbf{b}}, the automaton goes into state $\mathbf{q_2}$

% "Introduction to Formal Languages" by Peter Linz:
% * Page 42 shows a minimal automaton with two nodes and an edge. Then proceeds to show a simple graph that determines whether a variable identifier is valid
% * Page 44 shows the state diagram of a bit adder and explains the correlation to physical computer design: "As this example indicates, the automaton serves as a bridge between the very high-level, functional description of a circuit and its logical implementation through transistors, gates, and flip-flops. The automaton clearly shows the decision logic, yet it is formal enough to lend itself to precise mathematical manipulation.  For this reason, digital design methods rely heavily on concepts from automata theory"

% Transducer example (page 46):
% Digital computers normally represent all information by bit strings, using some type of encoding. For example, character information can be encoded using the well-known ASCII system. For this exercise, consider the two alphabets {a, b, c, d} and {0, 1}, respectively, and an encoding from the first to the second, defined by a → 00, b → 01, c → 10, d → 11. Construct a transducer for decoding strings on {0, 1} into the original message. For example, the input 010011 should generate as output "bad".

% Let students draw a transition graph from the transition function δ (probably say that q0 is the initial state and list the final states). Make clear that the automaton has an alphabet and that the inputs to the transition function δ are symbols from that alphabet
% Page 50 offers an example for that and also discusses which strings the accepter accepts
% An accepter has an associated languages: the languages is the set of strings that the accepter (the automaton) accepts
% Maybe introduce set notation for formal languages `L = {aⁿb : n ≥ 0}`
% Exercise inspired by the one on page 52: `L = {aⁿbⁿ : n ≥ 0}`. Example strings: "", "ab", "aabb", "aaabbb". Is this possible for a DFA (deterministic finite automaton)?
% Page 55: an automaton rejecting input string if it contains "001", accepting all other strings
% From pages 56 and 83: A language is regular if there exists a finite accepter for it, therefore, every regular language can be discribed by a DFA or NFA. Chapter 3 dives into regular expressions
% I could present the definition of a regular language, as above, and have an exercise where students prove that a given language is regular by creating a DFA for it
